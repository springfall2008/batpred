You can download the logfile from the WebUI on the Dash tab select **predbat_debug.log**

**Predbat debug yaml file**
This is important for any plan related issues.

Once you have captured the issue go to the Web UI, in the Dash tab click on **predbat_debug.yaml** and wait 30 seconds for it to download. Select 'keep' if your Web Browser thinks the file is dangerous.

Rename the download file to predbat_debug.yaml.txt and upload it to GitHub. This will allow your plan to be reproduced and also stores all your settings for review.
