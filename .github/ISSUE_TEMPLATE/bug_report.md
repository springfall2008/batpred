**Log file**
Can you capture a log file from the time of the issue, debug mode is not normally required.

**Predbat debug yaml file**
Enable debug mode and let Predbat run for one cycle. Look in the 'debug' directory under the Predbat add-on and take the .yaml file for the time period in question.
Rename the predbat_debug_XX_XX_XX.yaml to predbat_debug_XX_XX_XX.yaml.txt and upload it to Github. This will allow your plan to be reproduced and also stores all your settings for review.
