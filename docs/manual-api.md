# Predbat automation API

**CAUTION** This is an expert feature only, you can break Predbat if you set the wrong things here.

While for most people Predbat will do what you want without any adjustments there are some special cases where users wish to write some more complex
automations which override Predbat settings

For settings inside Home Assistant e.g. switch.predbat_*, select.predbat_* and input_number.predbat_* you can already use an automation to change these values

For settings in apps.yaml its very difficult or impossible to update them via an automation.

For this reasons there is a selector called **select.predbat_manual_api** which works a bit like the manual override ones but this can have new values added using the select API in Home Assistant.
The only function the selector itself serves is to store override commands, you can clear from the selector but you have to set them using a service call.

Certain settings from apps.yaml maybe overridden using this method.

Each override is in a string format and works a bit like a web URL, setting the command and the values.

## Data retention

The data for overrides is kept inside the Home Assistant selector itself and so will survive a reboot. There is likely a limit to the size of this data so be sure to remove
old overrides when you are done with them. Keep in mind its easy to lose all of the overrides with the 'off' option so do not keep important data here only use it for short term
automations.

## Supported command formats

The supported formats are:

```text
off
<command>=<value>
<command>(index)=<value>
<command>?<name>=<value>
<command>(index)?<name>=<value>
<command>?<name>=<value>&<name2>=<value2>
<command>(index)?<name>=<value>&<name2>=<value2>
```

Commands are disabled again by putting them in square brackets e.g:

```text
[<command>?<name>=<value>&<name2>=<value2>]
````

Below is an example of setting a rate override, you can clear all overrides by calling 'off' or this specific one only by calling the same thing again but in square brackets []

For the rates you can use **rates_export_override** or **rates_import_override** with all the same options as apps.yaml but in a URL type format

```text
rates_export_override?start=17:00:00&end=19:00:00&rate=0
```

If you override a single value item in a list with something like:

```text
inverter_limit(0)=4000
```

To disable this override again:

```text
[inverter_limit(0)=4000]
```

If you omit the index then all entries in the list will be overridden.

To disable all overrides

```text
off
```
