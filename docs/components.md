# Predbat Components Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all Predbat components, their purposes, and configuration options.

## Overview

Predbat uses a modular component architecture where each component provides specific functionality such as database management, cloud API integration, web interfaces, and energy provider integrations.
Each component can be enabled or disabled independently through your `apps.yaml` configuration file.

## Component List

### Database Manager (db)

**Can be restarted:** No

#### What it does (db)

Stores and manages all historical data for Predbat, including energy usage, sensor values, and system states. This allows Predbat to keep its own database of historical information independent of Home Assistant.

#### When to enable (db)

- You want to retain data longer than Home Assistant keeps or you want to run Predbat without Home Assistant

#### Configuration Options (db)

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Config Key | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `db_enable` | Boolean | Yes | - | `db_enable` | Set to `true` to enable the database, `false` to disable |
| `db_days` | Integer | No | 30 | `db_days` | Number of days of historical data to keep in the database |

---

### Home Assistant Interface (ha)

**Can be restarted:** No

#### What it does (ha)

Provides the connection between Predbat and Home Assistant. This is the core communication channel that allows Predbat to read sensor data, control devices, and update its status in Home Assistant.

If you are using Predbat without Home Assistant then this interface layer just talks directly to the Database Manager.

#### When to enable (ha)

This component is always enabled and required for Predbat to function.

#### Configuration Options (ha)

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Config Key | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `ha_url` | String | No | `http://supervisor/core` | `ha_url` | Home Assistant API URL (the default is for when using an HA add-on) |
| `ha_key` | String | No | Auto-detected | `ha_key` | Home Assistant access token (auto-detected when running as add-on) |
| `db_enable` | Boolean | No | False | `db_enable` | Enable database integration |
| `db_mirror_ha` | Boolean | No | False | `db_mirror_ha` | Copy Home Assistant data into Predbat's database |
| `db_primary` | Boolean | No | False | `db_primary` | Use Predbat's database instead of Home Assistant for the primary data source |

---

### Home Assistant History (ha_history)

**Can be restarted:** No

#### What it does (ha_history)

Retrieves and processes historical sensor data from Home Assistant's database (or from the Predbat database).
This component handles all lookups of past energy usage, battery levels, and other historical information.

#### When to enable (ha_history)

This component is always enabled.

#### Configuration Options (ha_history)

No configuration required. This component automatically uses your Home Assistant connection.

---

### Web Interface (web)

**Can be restarted:** Yes

#### What it does (web)

Provides a built-in web server that lets you view and manage Predbat through your web browser. Access dashboards, view battery plans, check logs, and edit configuration all from an easy-to-use web interface.

#### Configuration Options (web)

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Config Key | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `port` | Integer | No | 5052 | `web_port` | Port number for the web server |

#### How to access (web)

If you use Predbat is a Home Assistant add on then click 'Open Web UI' from the add-on or add Predbat Web UI to your side bar.
If you run Predbat outside then you can access it from the port as configured:  `http://homename:5052`

---

### MCP Server (mcp)

**Can be restarted:** Yes

#### What it does (mcp)

Provides a programmatic API that allows AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or other MCP-compatible tools) to read and control Predbat. This enables you to use natural language commands to check status, adjust settings, or override plans.

#### When to enable (mcp)

- You want to control Predbat through AI assistants
- You're building custom integrations or tools
- You want programmatic access to Predbat data

#### Security note (mcp)

The MCP server requires a secret key for authentication. Keep this secret secure and don't share it publicly.

***CAUTION*** Predbat WebUI does not support https currently, so exposing this MCP port externally to your home network would be unwise.

#### Configuration Options (mcp)

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Config Key | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `mcp_enable` | Boolean | Yes | False | `mcp_enable` | Set to `true` to enable the MCP server |
| `mcp_secret` | String | No | `predbat_mcp_secret` | `mcp_secret` | Secret key for authentication - change this! |
| `mcp_port` | Integer | No | 8199 | `mcp_port` | Port number for the MCP server |

#### How to configure your MCP client (mcp)

Below is an example MCP configuration inside VSCode, but it will be similar in Cline/Claude/Cursor etc.

```json
Example usage in VSCode
{
 "servers": {
  "predbat-mcp": {
   "url": "http://homeassistant.local:8199/mcp",
   "type": "http",
   "description": "Predbat Model Context Protocol Server",
   "headers": {
    "Authorization" : "Bearer predbat_mcp_secret",
   },
  }
 },
 "inputs": []
}
```

#### Available commands (mcp)

- Get current system status
- View and update configuration settings
- Browse all entities
- Retrieve battery plan data
- Override plan for specific time periods
- Access apps.yaml configuration

## Managing Components

### Checking Component Status

You can check the status of all components through the web interface:

1. Open the web interface (default: `http://your-ha-ip:5052`)
2. Navigate to the **Components** page (`/components`)
3. View the status of each component:
   - **Enabled/Disabled** - Whether the component is configured
   - **Running/Stopped** - Current operational status
   - **Healthy/Unhealthy** - Whether the component is working correctly
   - **Last Updated** - When the component last successfully updated

### Restarting Components

Most components can be restarted if they encounter problems:

- Use the restart button on the Components page in the web interface
- Or restart Predbat entirely to restart all components

**Note:** Core components (Database Manager, Home Assistant Interface, and Home Assistant History) cannot be restarted individually and require a full Predbat restart.

### Component Health

A component is considered healthy when:

- Its task is running
- It has updated within the last 60 minutes
- It reports no errors

If a component becomes unhealthy:

1. Check your configuration in `apps.yaml`
2. Verify API keys and credentials are correct
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review Predbat logs for error messages
5. Try restarting the component
