# Configuration guide

First get the basics set up, ensure you have the inverter controls configured, the historical load data and the solar forecast in place. Make sure your energy rates are configured correctly for import and export.

If you have an EV try to set up the car charging sensor correctly so the tool can tell what part of your historical load is EV charging. You might want to also set to the car charging plan so you can predict when your car is plugged in and how much it will charge.

You should try to tune **inverter_loss**, **battery_loss** and **battery_loss_discharge** to the correct % loss for your system in order to get more accurate predictions. Around 4% for each is good for a hybrid inverter. Also set **inverter_hybrid** to True or False depending on if you have a Hybrid or AC Coupled battery.

The setting **input_number.metric_battery_cycle** (_expert mode_) can be used to put a cost on using your battery for charging and discharging. In theory if you think your battery will last say 6000 complete cycles and cost you £4000 and is 9.5kWh then each cycle is 19kWh and so the cost is £4000 / 19 / 6000 = 3.5p. If you configure this number higher then more expensive plans will be selected which avoid charging and discharging your battery as much. The default is 2p but can be set to 0 if you want to turn this off. Note that the cycle cost will not be included in the cost predictions, just taken into account in the planning stage. _Note: Setting this to a non-zero zero will increase your daily cost, but will reduce your home battery usage._

Cloud coverage is modelled by using difference between PV and PV10 is used to work out a cloud factor, this modulates the PV output predictions up and down accordingly as if there was passing clouds. This can have an impact on planning, especially for things like freeze charging which could assume the PV will cover the house load but it might not due to clouds.

Below is a guide to some of the tariff options, in theory most tariffs will work out of the box but still it's worth reviewing your settings.

## Fixed daily rates

- In this case you will just be predicting the battery levels, no charging or discharging is required although it won't hurt if you leave these options enabled.

## Cheap night rate with bad export rate (e.g. Octopus Go, Economy 7 etc)

- In this scenario you will want to charge overnight based on the next days solar forecast.

Recommended settings - these must be changed in Home Assistant once Predbat is running:

```yaml
calculate_best_charge - True       # You want the tool to calculate charging
set_charge_window - True           # You want to have Predbat control the charge window
best_soc_keep - 2.0                # Tweak this to control what battery level you want to keep as a backup in case you use more energy
combine_charge_slots - True        # Use one big charge slot 
```

If you are using expert mode then these options maybe worth reviewing:

```yaml
forecast_plan_hours - 24           # If you set this to 24 then you will have quicker updates, the cycle repeats itself anyhow
combine_charge_slots - True        # As you have just one overnight rate then one slot is fine
metric_min_improvement - 0         # Charge less if it's cost neutral
rate_low_threshold - 0.8           # Consider a 20% reduction in rates or more as a low rate
forecast_plan_hours - 24           # In apps.yml set this to 24 hours to match the repeating rates
```

## Cheap night rate, with a good export rate (e.g. Intelligent Octopus with Octopus Outgoing)

Follow the instructions from Cheap Night rate above, but also you will want to have automatic discharge when the export rates are profitable.

```yaml
calculate_best_charge - True       # You want the tool to calculate charging
set_charge_window - True           # You want to have Predbat control the charge window
calculate_best_discharge - True    # Enable discharge calculation
best_soc_keep - 2.0                # Tweak this to control what battery level you want to keep as a backup in case you use more energy
combine_charge_slots - True        # Use one big charge slot 
```

If you are using expert mode then these options maybe worth reviewing, otherwise ignore this:

```yaml
predbat_metric_battery_cycle - ?        # You can set this to maybe 2-5p if you want to avoid cycling the battery too much
combine_charge_slots - True             # Keep one big charge slot
metric_min_improvement - 0              # Charge less if it's cost neutral
metric_min_improvement_discharge - 0.1  # Discharge even if cost neutral, as you often need many slots to see the improvement
combine_charge_slots - ?                # If you set this to False then you can allow import in larger periods of day rates to fund extra export
```

## Multiple rates for import and export (e.g. Octopus Flux & Cozy)

Follow the instructions from Cheap Night rate above, but also you will want to have automatic discharge when the export rates are profitable.

Recommended settings - these must be changed in Home Assistant once Predbat is running:

```yaml
calculate_best_charge - True            # You want the tool to calculate charging
set_charge_window - True                # You want to have Predbat control the charge window
calculate_best_discharge - True         # Enable discharge calculation
set_discharge_window - True             # Allow the tool to control the discharge slots
best_soc_keep - 0.0                     # Setting this to 0 is best cost wise
```

If you are using expert mode then these options maybe worth reviewing, otherwise ignore this:

```yaml
metric_battery_cycle - ?                # You can set this to maybe 2-5p if you want to avoid cycling the battery too much
metric_min_improvement - 0              # Charge less if it's cost neutral
metric_min_improvement_discharge - 0.1  # Make sure discharge only happens if it makes a profit
combine_charge_slots - True             # Keep one big charge slot to speed things up
best_soc_min - 0.0                      # Must be 0 or the charging will happen on all slots
```

## Half hourly variable rates (e.g. Octopus Agile)

Recommended settings - these must be changed in Home Assistant once Predbat is running:

```yaml
calculate_best_charge - True            # You want the tool to calculate charging
set_charge_window - True                # You want to have Predbat control the charge window
calculate_best_discharge - True        # Enable discharge calculation
```
