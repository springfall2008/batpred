# Output data

Each time Predbat runs it outputs a lot of information about the current performance of your solar/battery system and the predicted load, PV, cost, CO2, car charging, etc.

This section of the documentation explains the different output and logging data that Predbat produces and gives an overview of how to display that information within Home Assistant.
There can never be a single Predbat dashboard that suits every user, so instead Predbat gives a starter-set of displays that can be adapted to your individual needs.

## Web interface

Predbat has a Web interface active on port 5025 which can be opened by clicking on Web Interface from the Add-on or directly opening the port in your browser
e.g. <http://homeassistant.local:5052/>

The Web interface can allow you to view the current plan, adjust the configuration, check your apps.yaml and view the logfiles. You can change your view using
the top menu bar.

## Displaying output data

Each Predbat configuration item is named *input_number.predbat_xxx*, *switch.predbat_yyy* or *select.predbat_zzz* depending on the control type.

### Creating a simple Predbat dashboard

Each time Predbat runs it auto-generates a dashboard with the filename **predbat_dashboard.yaml** that can be used as a starter for your own Predbat dashboard.
Depending on how you installed Predbat this predbat_dashboard.yaml file will be held in one of three different directories in Home Assistant:

- if you have used the [Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#predbat-add-on-install), it will be in the directory `/addon_configs/6adb4f0d_predbat/`,

- if the [combined AppDaemon/Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#appdaemon-predbat-combined-install) was used, it's in `/addon_configs/46f69597_appdaemon-predbat/`,
or

- with the [HACS, Appdaemon add-on then Predbat installation method](install.md#predbat-installation-into-appdaemon), it's `/config/appdaemon/apps/batpred/config/`.

You will need to use a file editor within Home Assistant (e.g. either the File editor or Studio Code Server add-on's) to open
the predbat_dashboard.yaml file - see [editing configuration files within Home Assistant](install.md#editing-configuration-files-in-home-assistant) if you need to install an editor.

Once opened, select and copy all the contents of the predbat_dashboard.yaml file and add the contents into a new dashboard page:

- Go to System/Dashboards, click 'Open' against an existing dashboard or 'Add Dashboard'/'New dashboard from scratch'/enter a name/click Create, then click 'Open'

- Click the pencil icon in the top right corner, click the blue 'Add card', scroll down the list of cards to the bottom and click 'Manual',
delete the template card configuration and paste the contents of the predbat_dashboard.yaml file copied earlier, then 'Save'.

This will give you a simple Predbat control and output dashboard that you can then resequence and customise as you wish.

### Creating a compact Predbat control dashboard

You can also create a dashboard page that's dynamically generated to automatically include all the Predbat control and output entities,
so when new entities are added in future Predbat releases, you don't have to edit the dashboard.

Firstly you need to [install HACS](install.md#hacs-install) if it isn't already installed, and then install two HACS front end components:

- Auto Entities ([https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities))
automatically generates a list of entities that match a wildcard expression
- Lovelace Collapsable Cards ([https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards](https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards))
wraps the entity lists within a drop-down toggle

Installation steps:

- Click the HACS icon on the left-hand side panel
- Click 'Frontend'
- Click the three dots in the top right corner then 'Custom Repositories'
- Paste (or type) in the following repository name `https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards`, choose Category of 'Lovelace', and click Add
- Close the Custom repositories dialogue
- Click 'Explore & Download Repositories'
- Search for 'collapsable cards', click the name of it, check it's the right one, click 'Download', 'Download' again, then 'Reload'
- Click 'Explore & Download Repositories' again, search for 'auto-entities', then 'Download', 'Download', 'Reload'

Now create the dynamic dashboard:

- Go to System/Dashboards, click 'Open' against an existing dashboard or 'Add Dashboard'/'New dashboard from scratch'/enter a name/click Create, then click 'Open'

- Click the pencil icon in the top right corner, click the blue 'Add card', scroll down the list of cards to the bottom and click 'Manual',
delete the template card configuration and paste the following YAML into the dashboard and click 'Save':

### Viewing the Predbat plan

The Predbat Plan card is very useful for seeing the plan that Predbat has created - [Create the Predbat Plan card](predbat-plan-card.md).

### Graphing the Predbat predictions

A set of Apex Charts can also be created to see graphically what Predbat plans to do - [Creating the charts](creating-charts.md).

## Basic status

- **switch.predbat_active** - Automatically set by Predbat to On when Predbat is busy calculating or controlling your inverter,
or Off when Predbat is waiting for the next time it needs to perform a plan calculation update.
If you toggle this switch in Home Assistant it will force Predbat to perform an update now (useful for automations).

- **predbat.status** - Gives the current status & errors and logs any changes that Predbat makes to your inverter.
The different Predbat status values and their meanings are detailed in [what does Predbat do](what-does-predbat-do.md#predbat-status).

![image](https://github.com/springfall2008/batpred/assets/48591903/e24914b8-93d9-4217-812a-ac25a569a52c)

predbat.status additionally has the following attributes that are automatically populated:

- **Last updated** - date and time that Predbat last updated the plan
- **Debug** - A set of arrays containing Predbat's planned charging and discharging time windows and battery limits (in kWh)
- **Version** - version of Predbat that's running
- **Error** - binary value true or false depending upon whether Predbat is in an error status or nor

## Baseline data

What your battery is expected to do *over the forecast_hours duration of the plan* with no changes made by Predbat:

NB: Predbat forecasts are from 'now' to the forecast_hours duration (set in apps.yaml) into the future and shouldn't be confused with 'today' figures.
e.g. predbat.pv_energy is the predicted PV energy for today and forecast_hours (typically 48) ahead
so will be much larger than sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today which is today's Solcast PV forecast.

- predbat.battery_hours_left - The number of hours left until your home battery is predicted to run out (stops at the maximum prediction time)
- predbat.charge_limit - The current charge limit used for the scenario in %
- predbat.charge_limit_kw - The current charge limit used for the scenario in kWh
- predbat.duration - The duration of the prediction maximum in hours

minute by minute prediction data (in attributes) which can be charted with Apex Charts (or similar)
- predbat.soc_min_kwh - The minimum battery level during the time period in kWh
- predbat.metric - Predicted cost metric for the next simulated period (in pence). Also contains data for charting cost in the entity attributes

- predbat.car_soc - The expected charge level of your car at the end of the plan. Can also be charted
- input_number.predbat_iboost_today - Gives the amount of energy modelled that will be sent to the solar diverter today,
increments during the day and is reset to zero at 11:30pm each night

## PV 10% baseline data

The calculated baseline results under PV 10% scenario for the forecast_hours duration of the plan:

- predbat.soc_kw_base10 - As soc_kw but using the 10% solar forecast, also holds minute by minute data (in attributes) to be charted
- predbat.base10_pv_energy - Predicted PV 10% energy in kWh
- predbat.base10_metric - Predicted cost for PV 10%

- predbat.best10_metric - Predicted best cost for PV 10%
- predbat.best10_export_energy- Predicted best export energy for PV 10%
- predbat.best10_load_energy - Predicted best load energy for PV 10%
- predbat.best10_import_energy- Predicted best import energy for PV 10%

## Battery status

The following sensors are set based upon what Predbat is currently controlling the battery to do:

- binary_sensor.predbat_charging - Set to 'on' when Predbat is force charging the battery (from solar, or if that is insufficient, from grid import), or 'off' otherwise
- binary_sensor.predbat_discharging - Set to 'on' when Predbat is force discharging the battery for export income, 'off' otherwise.
Useful for automations if for example you want to turn off car charging when the battery is being exported

## Energy rate data

### Low import rate entities

- predbat.low_rate_cost - The lowest import rate cost in Pence
- predbat.low_rate_start - Start time of the next low import rate slot

- predbat.rates_export - The current energy export rates in Pence (also can be charted)
- predbat.cost_today - The total cost of energy so far today (since midnight)

## Car data

- binary_sensor.predbat_car_charging_slot - A binary sensor indicating when to charge your car (if car planning is enabled) - which can be used in an automation
as described in [Predbat led car charging](car-charging.md#car-charging-planning)
- predbat.car_charging_start - The time that car charging is planned to start at, in HH:MM:SS format

## iBoost Solar Diverter data

- binary_sensor.predbat_iboost_active - A binary sensor indicating when there is excess solar and the solar diverter (e.g. iBoost, Eddi or just plain immersion heater) should be active,
can be used for automations to trigger the immersion heater boost

## Energy saving data

- predbat.cost_yesterday - A sensor that gives you your energy costs for yesterday (00:00-23:59 on the previous day)

## Solar forecast data

- sensor.predbat_pv_today - Tracks the PV forecast for today, attributes give the remaining amount today and the half hourly data
- sensor.predbat_pv_tomorrow - Tracks the PV forecast for tomorrow, attributes give the remaining amount today and the half hourly data

## Predbat Logfile

Predbat writes detailed logging, status and progress activity information to a logfile as it runs and so this file should be checked if **predbat.status** reports an error,
or if you want to verify that Predbat is running OK.

There is a lot of output in the logfile, this is normal!

Depending on how you installed Predbat the logfile will be held in one of three different directories in Home Assistant and the filename varies slightly:

- if you have used the [Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#predbat-add-on-install), the logfile will be `/addon_configs/6adb4f0d_predbat/predbat.log`,

- if the [combined AppDaemon/Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#appdaemon-predbat-combined-install) was used, it's `/addon_configs/46f69597_appdaemon-predbat/predbat.log`,
or

- with the [HACS, Appdaemon add-on then Predbat installation method](install.md#predbat-installation-into-appdaemon), it's `/homeassistant/appdaemon/appdaemon.log`.

You will need to use a file editor within Home Assistant (e.g. either the File editor or Studio Code Server add-on's)
to view Predbat's logfile - see [editing configuration files within Home Assistant](install.md#editing-configuration-files-in-home-assistant) if you need to install an editor.

## Automated monitoring that Predbat and GivTCP are running OK

With GivTCP and Predbat performing an important function, managing your battery charging and discharging to best reduce your electricity bills,
you may find these automations useful to monitor that GivTCP and Predbat are running OK, and if not, to raise an alert on your mobile device.

### GivTCP activity monitor

This automation will raise an alert if any of the following occur:

- The inverter goes offline for more than 15 minutes
- No last_updated_time received from the inverter for more than 15 minutes
- Inverter temperature less than 5 degrees for more than 15 minutes (should never happen)
- The battery goes offline to the inverter for more than 15 minutes
- GivTCP add-on is not running
- Mosquitto broker add-on is not running
- Predbat/AppDaemon-predbat or AppDaemon add-on (as appropriate) is not running

The script will need to be customised for your inverter id, battery id and mobile details,
and can be extended for multiple inverters and batteries by duplicating the triggers and adding appropriate battery and inverter id's.

```yaml

The last three triggers (GivTCP, Mosquitto and Predbat/AppDaemon running) trigger if any of these add-ons that Predbat is dependent upon are not running.
You will need to enable a binary sensor for each add-on to be able to use these triggers in the automation:

- Navigate to Settings / Devices and Services / Devices and search for 'GivTCP'
- Click on the GivTCP add-on, and under 'Sensors', click 'XX entities not shown'
- Click the 'Running' sensor, then the cogwheel, and Enable the sensor

Repeat these steps for the 'Mosquitto' add-on and either 'Predbat', 'AppDaemon' or 'AppDaemon-predbat' depending on which AppDaemon install option you followed.

As an extension to the above, instead of just alerting that GivTCP has a problem, the automation could also restart GivTCP add-on which usually cures most GivTCP connectivity issues.
Restarting GivTCP does however lose the current GivTCP log in Home Assistant.

To restart the GivTCP add-on, add the following at the end of the action section:

```yaml
  - service: hassio.addon_restart
    data:
      addon: a6a2857d_givtcp
```

### Predbat error monitor

This automation will raise an alert if Predbat's status turns to *ERROR* for more than 10 minutes.

The script will need to be customised for your mobile details.

```yaml
alias: Predbat error monitor
description: Alert when Predbat has raised an exception
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - predbat.status
    to: "ERROR: Exception raised"
    for:
      minutes: 10
  - platform: template
    value_template: "{{ 'ERROR' in states('predbat.status') }}"
    for:
      minutes: 10
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - predbat.status
    attribute: error
    to: "true"
    for:
      minutes: 10
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_<your mobile device id>
    data:
      title: Predbat status issue
      message: |
        {{ now().timestamp() | timestamp_custom('%-d %b %H:%M') }} ISSUE:
        Predbat status is {{ states('predbat.status') }}, error={{
        state_attr('predbat.status', 'error') }}
      data:
        visibility: public
        persistent: true
        push:
          sound:
            name: default
            critical: 1
            volume: 0.8
        sticky: true
        color: red
mode: single
```

An error alert looks like this:
