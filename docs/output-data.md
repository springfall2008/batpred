# Output data

Each time Predbat runs it outputs a lot of information about the current performance of your solar/battery system and the predicted load, PV, cost, CO2, car charging, etc.

This section of the documentation explains the different output and logging data that Predbat produces and gives an overview of how to display that information within Home Assistant.
There can never be a single Predbat dashboard that suits every user, so instead Predbat gives a starter-set of displays that can be adapted to your individual needs.

## Web interface

**NOTE:** The Predbat web interface will not work with the AppDaemon or the Predbat-appdaemon installation methods.

Predbat has a Web interface active can be opened via the Predbat Add on by clicking on 'Web UI'. The web interface can be added to your sidebar by turning on the 'Show in Sidebar' toggle.

If you are not using the Predbat Add on then you may be able to access the Web Interface directly on port 5052 (e.g. with a Docker Container or Native on your Linux/MAC).

The Web interface can allow you to view the current plan, adjust the configuration, view the charts, check your apps.yaml and view the logfiles. You can change your view using
the top menu bar.

## Displaying output data

Each Predbat configuration item is named *input_number.predbat_xxx*, *switch.predbat_yyy* or *select.predbat_zzz* depending on the control type.

### Creating a simple Predbat dashboard

Each time Predbat runs it auto-generates a dashboard with the filename **predbat_dashboard.yaml** that can be used as a starter for your own Predbat dashboard.
Depending on how you installed Predbat this predbat_dashboard.yaml file will be held in one of three different directories in Home Assistant:

- if you have used the [Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#predbat-add-on-install), it will be in the directory `/addon_configs/6adb4f0d_predbat/`,

- if the [combined AppDaemon/Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#appdaemon-predbat-combined-install) was used, it's in `/addon_configs/46f69597_appdaemon-predbat/`,
or

- with the [HACS, Appdaemon add-on then Predbat installation method](install.md#predbat-installation-into-appdaemon), it's `/config/appdaemon/apps/batpred/config/`.

You will need to use a file editor within Home Assistant (e.g. either the File editor or Studio Code Server add-on's) to open
the predbat_dashboard.yaml file - see [editing configuration files within Home Assistant](install.md#editing-configuration-files-in-home-assistant) if you need to install an editor.

Once opened, select and copy all the contents of the predbat_dashboard.yaml file and add the contents into a new dashboard page:

- Go to System/Dashboards, click 'Open' against an existing dashboard or 'Add Dashboard'/'New dashboard from scratch'/enter a name/click Create, then click 'Open'

- Click the pencil icon in the top right corner, click the blue 'Add card', scroll down the list of cards to the bottom and click 'Manual',
delete the template card configuration and paste the contents of the predbat_dashboard.yaml file copied earlier, then 'Save'.

This will give you a simple Predbat control and output dashboard that you can then resequence and customise as you wish.

### Creating a compact Predbat control dashboard

You can also create a dashboard page that's dynamically generated to automatically include all the Predbat control and output entities,
so when new entities are added in future Predbat releases, you don't have to edit the dashboard.

Firstly you need to [install HACS](install.md#hacs-install) if it isn't already installed, and then install two HACS front end components:

- Auto Entities ([https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities))
automatically generates a list of entities that match a wildcard expression
- Lovelace Collapsable Cards ([https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards](https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards))
wraps the entity lists within a drop-down toggle

Installation steps:

- Click the HACS icon on the left-hand side panel
- Click 'Frontend'
- Click the three dots in the top right corner then 'Custom Repositories'
- Paste (or type) in the following repository name `https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards`, choose Category of 'Lovelace', and click Add
- Close the Custom repositories dialogue
- Click 'Explore & Download Repositories'
- Search for 'collapsable cards', click the name of it, check it's the right one, click 'Download', 'Download' again, then 'Reload'
- Click 'Explore & Download Repositories' again, search for 'auto-entities', then 'Download', 'Download', 'Reload'

Now create the dynamic dashboard:

- Go to Settings/Dashboards, click 'Open' against an existing dashboard or 'Add Dashboard'/'New dashboard from scratch'/enter a name/click Create, then click 'Open'
- Click the pencil icon in the top right corner, then the plus symbol on the far right of the next row to create a new View
- Enter a title of the View, then Save
- Click the blue 'Add card', scroll down the list of cards to the bottom and click 'Manual',
delete the template card configuration and copy/paste the following YAML into the dashboard and click 'Save':

### Viewing the Predbat plan

- **predbat.plan_html** - A sensor that contains a HTML render of the Predbat  predicted best plan, detailing import and export rates, predicted house load, solar generation,
battery SoC, car and iBoost charging, and Predbat's planned charging and discharging activities.

Its recommended to [Create the Predbat Plan card](predbat-plan-card.md) as an easy way to see the plan that Predbat has created.

If you are using the Predbat add-on then the predbat plan can also be viewed via the 'Plan' tab of the [Predbat web console](#web-interface).

### Graphing the Predbat predictions

A set of Apex Charts can also be created to see graphically what Predbat plans to do - [Creating the charts](creating-charts.md).

## Basic status

- **switch.predbat_active** - Automatically set by Predbat to On when Predbat is busy calculating or controlling your inverter,
or Off when Predbat is waiting for the next time it needs to perform a plan calculation update.
If you toggle this switch in Home Assistant it will force Predbat to perform an update now (useful for automations).

- **predbat.status** - Gives the current status & errors and logs any changes that Predbat makes to your inverter.
The different Predbat status values and their meanings are detailed in [what does Predbat do](what-does-predbat-do.md#predbat-status).

![image](https://github.com/springfall2008/batpred/assets/48591903/e24914b8-93d9-4217-812a-ac25a569a52c)

predbat.status additionally has the following attributes that are automatically populated:

- **Last updated** - date and time that Predbat last updated the plan
- **Debug** - A set of arrays containing Predbat's planned charging and discharging time windows and battery limits (in kWh)
- **Version** - version of Predbat that's running
- **Error** - binary value true or false depending upon whether Predbat is in an error status or nor

## Baseline data

Predbat outputs the following sensors to predict what your battery is expected to do *over the forecast_hours duration of the plan* with no changes made by Predbat.
This is considered to be the 'baseline' plan:

NB: All of Predbat's forecasts are from midnight today to the forecast_hours duration (set in apps.yaml) into the future and shouldn't be confused with 'today' figures.

e.g. predbat.pv_energy is the actual PV energy from midnight today, and for the predicted forecast_hours (typically 48) ahead
so will be much larger than sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today which is today's Solcast PV forecast.

## 'Today' energy data

The following sensors output by Predbat give the 'today' energy readings.
They mirror input sensors fed into Predbat in apps.yaml and are used in the data prediction chart - see [creating the Predbat charts](creating-charts.md):

- predbat.export_energy_h0 - Mirrors the export_today sensor configured in apps.yaml and gives today's total kWh of export energy
- predbat.import_energy_h0 - Mirrors the import_today sensor configured in apps.yaml and gives today's total kWh of import energy
- predbat.load_energy_h0 - Mirrors the load_today sensor configured in apps.yaml and gives today's total kWh of house load energy
- predbat.pv_energy_h0 - Mirrors the pv_today sensor configured in apps.yaml and gives today's total kWh of generated PV energy
- predbat.soc_kw_h0 - Mirrors the soc_kwh sensor configured in apps.yaml and gives today's total kWh of battery state of charge (SoC).
Note that if you have configured [battery scaling](apps-yaml.md#battery-size-scaling) then soc_kw_h0 will have been scaled by the configured scaling factor

## Battery status

The following sensors are set based upon what Predbat is currently controlling the battery to do:

predbat.carbon_best - Predicted Carbon intensity in g for your home under the best plan based on grid imports, grid exports and the grid's projected carbon intensity
predbat.carbon_now - A sensor that gives the current Grid Carbon intensity in g/kWh
predbat.carbon_today - A sensor that tracks your home's Carbon impact today in g based on your grid import minus your grid export

## Energy saving data

The following sensors output by Predbat give cost saving data that Predbat achieved, i.e. the financial benefits of using Predbat.
They are used in the daily cost saving and total cost savings charts - see [creating the Predbat charts](creating-charts.md):

- predbat.cost_yesterday - A sensor that gives the total energy costs in pence for yesterday (00:00-23:59 on the previous day)

- predbat.savings_yesterday_pvbat - A sensor which tells you how much money you saved from using Predbat
vs not having a PV and battery system at all and all house load being met from grid import

## Solar forecast data

The following sensors give the forecast Solar data from Solcast.
Predbat populates these sensors irrespective of whether you are using the [Predbat direct Solcast or Solcast integration method](install.md#solcast-install) to get your Solar forecast,
but if you are using the Solcast integration then the Predbat sensors mirror the similarly named Solcast integration sensors so could be disabled if you so wish.

- sensor.predbat_pv_today - Tracks the PV forecast in kWh for today, attributes give the remaining amount today and the half hourly data
- sensor.predbat_pv_tomorrow - Tracks the PV forecast in kWh for tomorrow, attributes give the remaining amount today and the half hourly data
- sensor.predbat_pv_d2 - Similar to the above, but tracking the PV forecast for the day after tomorrow
- sensor.predbat_pv_d3 - PV forecast for two days after tomorrow
- sensor.predbat_pv_forecast_h0 - Tracks the PV 'power now' forecast in Watts, attributes give the 10% and 90% power now forecast

## Predbat Logfile

Predbat writes detailed logging, status and progress activity information to a logfile as it runs and so this file should be checked if **predbat.status** reports an error,
or if you want to verify that Predbat is running OK.

There is a lot of output in the logfile, this is normal!

If you are using the Predbat add-on then the logfile can easily be viewed via the 'Log' tab of the [Predbat web console](#web-interface).

To directly view the physical logfile, it can be found in one of three different directories in Home Assistant with slightly different filenames depending on how you installed Predbat:

- if you have used the [Predbat add-on installation method](install.md#predbat-add-on-install), the logfile will be `/addon_configs/6adb4f0d_predbat/predbat.log`,

- if the [HACS, Appdaemon add-on then Predbat installation method](install.md#predbat-installation-into-appdaemon), it's `/homeassistant/appdaemon/appdaemon.log`, or

- if the combined AppDaemon/Predbat add-on installation method was used, it's `/addon_configs/46f69597_appdaemon-predbat/predbat.log`.

You will need to use a file editor within Home Assistant (e.g. either the File editor or Studio Code Server add-on's)
to view Predbat's logfile if you are not using the Predbat add-on.
See [editing configuration files within Home Assistant](install.md#editing-configuration-files-in-home-assistant) if you need to install an editor.

## Automated monitoring that Predbat and GivTCP are running OK

With GivTCP and Predbat performing an important function, managing your battery charging and discharging to best reduce your electricity bills,
you may find these automations useful to monitor that GivTCP and Predbat are running OK, and if not, to raise an alert on your mobile device running the Home Assistant Companion app.

To create a new automation:

- Settings / Automations & Scenes
- Create Automation / Create new Automation
- Three dots (top right corner) / Edit in YAML
- Delete the existing (template) automation code and copy/paste the supplied automation code below

### GivTCP activity monitor

This automation will raise an alert if any of the following occur:

- The inverter goes offline for more than 15 minutes
- No last_updated_time received from the inverter for more than 15 minutes
- Inverter temperature less than 5 degrees for more than 15 minutes (should never happen)
- The battery goes offline to the inverter for more than 15 minutes
- GivTCP add-on is not running
- Mosquitto broker add-on is not running
- Predbat/AppDaemon-predbat or AppDaemon add-on (as appropriate) is not running

The script will need to be customised for your inverter id, battery id and mobile details,
and can be extended for multiple inverters and batteries by duplicating the triggers and adding appropriate battery and inverter id's.

```yaml
alias: GivTCP activity monitor
description: Alert when communications to GivTCP have ceased for 15 minutes
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: sensor.givtcp_<inverter id>_last_updated_time
    to: "null"
    for:
      minutes: 15
    variables:
      alert_text: No GivTCP update received from inverter <id>
      restart_app: GivTCP

      alert_text: GivTCP add-on is not running
      restart_app: GivTCP
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:

    to: "off"
    for:
      minutes: 15
    variables:
      alert_text: Mosquitto Broker add-on is not running
      restart_app: Mosquitto
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_<your mobile device id>
    alias: Send a notification
    data:
      title: GivTCP communication issue
      message: |
        {{now().strftime('%-d %b %H:%M')}} ISSUE:

            critical: 1
            volume: 0.8
          sticky: true
          color: red
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ restart_app == 'GivTCP' }}"
        sequence:
          - alias: Restart GivTCP add-on
            action: hassio.addon_restart
            data:
              addon: 533ea71a_givtcp
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ restart_app == 'Mosquitto' }}"
        sequence:
          - alias: Restart Mosquitto add-on
            action: hassio.addon_restart
            data:
              addon: core_mosquitto
trace:
  stored_traces: 20
mode: single
```

The last two triggers (GivTCP and Mosquitto running) trigger if any of these add-ons that Predbat is dependent upon are not running.
You will need to enable a binary sensor for each add-on to be able to use these triggers in the automation:

- Navigate to Settings / Devices and Services / Devices and search for 'GivTCP'
- Click on the GivTCP add-on, and under 'Sensors', click 'XX entities not shown'
- Click the 'Running' sensor, then the cogwheel, and Enable the sensor

Repeat these steps for the 'Mosquitto' add-on.

As an extension to the above, if you don't want the automation to restart the failing add-on and instead just send an alert that there is a problem, delete the 'choose' code above.
Restarting GivTCP does however lose the current GivTCP log in Home Assistant.

NB: If you are using GivTCP v2 rather than v3, replace the '533ea71a_givtcp' with 'a6a2857d_givtcp'.

### Predbat error monitor

This automation will raise an alert if Predbat's status turns to *Error* for more than 5 minutes.

In normal operation Predbat will automatically run and update its forecast every 5 minutes. If the automation detects that Predbat has not done this for 20 minutes,
then an alert will be raised and the automation will restart the Predbat add-on to try to resolve a 'hung Predbat' issue.

In the same way for the GivTCP and Mosquitto add-on's above, the last trigger requires you to enable a binary sensor that detects that the Predbat/AppDaemon add-on is running.
Follow the same steps to enable the binary sensor for either the 'Predbat', 'AppDaemon' or 'AppDaemon-predbat' add-on depending on which Predbat installation method you followed.

The script will need to be customised for your mobile details.

```yaml
alias: Predbat error monitor
description: Alert when Predbat has raised an exception
trace:
  stored_traces: 20
triggers:
  - trigger: template
    alias: Predbat status contains 'Error' for 5 minutes
    value_template: "{{ 'Error' in states('predbat.status') }}"
    for:
      minutes: 5
    variables:
      alert_text: >-
        predbat status is {{ states('predbat.status') }}, error={{
        state_attr('predbat.status', 'error') }}
  - trigger: state
    alias: Predbat is in error status for 5 minutes
    entity_id: predbat.status
    attribute: error

    for:
      minutes: 5
    variables:
      alert_text: >-
        predbat status is {{ states('predbat.status') }}, error={{
        state_attr('predbat.status', 'error') }}
  - trigger: state
    alias: Predbat status.last_updated has not changed for 20 minutes
    entity_id: predbat.status
    attribute: last_updated

        state_attr('predbat.status','last_updated')|as_timestamp|timestamp_custom('%a
        %H:%M') }}', unchanged for 20 mins; Status='{{ states('predbat.status')
        }}'
      restart_predbat: "Y"
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.predbat_running
    to: "off"
    for:
      minutes: 15
    variables:
      alert_text: Predbat add-on is not running
      restart_predbat: "Y"
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_<your mobile device id>
    alias: Send alert message
    data:
      title: Predbat status issue
      message: |
        {{now().strftime('%-d %b %H:%M')}} ISSUE:
        {{ alert_text }}
      data:
        visibility: public
        persistent: true
        push:
          sound:
            name: default
            critical: 1
            volume: 0.8
        sticky: true
        color: red
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ restart_predbat == 'Y' }}"
    then:
      - action: hassio.addon_restart
        data:
          addon: 6adb4f0d_predbat
        alias: Restart Predbat add-on
mode: single
```

NB: If you are using AppDaemon rather than the Predbat add-on, replace '6adb4f0d_predbat' with 'a0d7b954_appdaemon' and change 'binary_sensor.predbat_running' to 'binary_sensor.appdaemon_running'.

An error alert looks like this:
