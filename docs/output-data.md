# Output data

## Displaying output data

Each config item has an input_number or switch associated with it, you can find an auto generated dashboard for your configuration in your AppDaeamon configuration area under the filename **predbat_dashboard.yaml**

You can also create a card using 'dynamic-entities-card.yaml' for a dynamically created list of entities for predbat which groups the entities by type and is collapsed by default to prevent screen clutter. Requires lovelace-collapsable-cards ([https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards](https://github.com/RossMcMillan92/lovelace-collapsable-cards)) and lovelace-auto-entities ([https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities)) to be installed via HACS as well as the stock vertical stack card.
