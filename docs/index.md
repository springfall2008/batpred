# Introduction

Home battery prediction and automatic charging for Home Assistant supporting multiple inverters including GivEnergy, Solis, Huawei, SolarEdge and Sofar.

Also known by some as Batpred or Batman!

Some inverters have their own groups also e.g:

## Taster

Once you are up and running you will get a chart that predicts your battery levels over time:

And you can also see this in a plan format predicting your overall costs and your carbon footprint (if enabled, UK only for now):

You can see a cost over time for the plan that Predbat has made and also how it might turn out if your solar production (should you have solar)
is lower than expected or if you use a bit more energy than planned (10% scenario):

You can see your energy rates over time and where the battery is being charged:

Power charts can show you how the prediction maps to your inverter:

You can model iBoost or similar solar diverters, this will be shown on your plan and you can even use it to trigger smart devices e.g.
an emersion heater based on energy rates.

You can predict when your car will charge and use Predbat to schedule the cheapest car charging slots:

Charts can track your cost saving using Predbat and from having a PV and Battery system

The calibration chart is useful for tuning the model for things like inverter losses until it matches reality:

Predbat can track your actual vs predicted energy usage and make real time adjustments to the predictions if you use more or less:

You can tune lots of parameters to match your system and needs:

You can also override the plan on a temporary basis if you have a particular reason to:
