# ðŸš€ Feature: Plugin System Implementation

## Summary

**Core Plugin System (`plugin_system.py`)**

- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically finds and loads plugins from multiple directories (`plugins/`, same directory, parent directory)
- **Flexible plugin detection**: Supports multiple plugin patterns (classes ending in 'Plugin'', `PREDBAT_PLUGIN` marker, `initialize_plugin()` function)
- **Lifecycle hooks**: Provides four key integration points:
    - `on_init`: Called when plugin system initializes
    - `on_update`: Called during each update cycle
    - `on_shutdown`: Called during graceful shutdown
    - `on_web_start`: Called when web interface starts
- **Error resilience**: Continues loading other plugins even if one fails
- **Base class**: Optional `PredBatPlugin` base class for standardized plugin development

**Integration Points**

- **Main application**: Plugin system initializes after web interface startup and calls update hooks during each cycle
- **Web interface**: New endpoint registration system allows plugins to add custom HTTP endpoints dynamically
- **Graceful shutdown**: Ensures all plugins are properly cleaned up

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- Plugin files must end with `_plugin.py` for auto-discovery
- Plugins can be simple classes, inherit from `PredBatPlugin`, or use initialization functions
- Web endpoints can be registered by plugins for custom interfaces (e.g., metrics endpoints)
- Full error handling and logging throughout the plugin lifecycle
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

This plugin system enables:

- **Custom metrics collection** (Prometheus, InfluxDB, etc.)
- **Additional web interfaces** and dashboards
- **Third-party integrations** without modifying core code
- **Custom notification systems**
- **Extended data processing** and analysis

## ðŸ§ª Backward Compatibility

- Fully backward compatible - no changes to existing functionality
- Plugin system is optional and gracefully handles failures
- Existing code continues to work unchanged
